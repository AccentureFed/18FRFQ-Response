|e|created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library |To ensure our prototype was consistent and easy to maintain, the team utilized pattern libraries and created a light weight design guide to drive the UX and design patterns.  With the focus to put the user first through our prototype development, the pattern library allowed for consistency in our user experience on multiple device resolutions and orientations. Bootstrap was used to develop our responsive multi-device framework.  The team had two UX designers, one remote and one with an onsite presence with the team. Applying pattern libraries such as Font Awesome, Bootstrap UI and our custom design guide allowed consistency among our designers and mitigated a fragmented user experience.  Developing and implementing Pattern libraries and UI libraries also allowed the team to have functionality and design elements that could be reused, and standard with 508, keeping cost and time at a minimum. Collective Code Ownership was encouraged by establishing a pattern library and style guide to help provide consistency as elements were coded in a common way, making it easier for our front end developers to work across the code base. |

Usability testing provided unique feedback from hands on users.  It gave direct input on how real users would use our system and provided an unbiased view.  Usability test cases were created and administered with users matching our defined personas.   

[Usability Test Cases](https://github.com/AccentureFed/18FRFQ-Response/blob/master/process-documentation/user-centric-design/usability%20testing/usab%20questionaiere.docx?raw=true)

Local and remote usability testing was conducted.

Based on feedback received, the designs were refined and iterations made. 

A field survey was conducted at a local grocery chain to gain hands on feedback from individuals who would be using our prototype amongst their daily lives.  Four individuals provided a response and gave constructive feedback to drive functionality. 

The Site Survey entailed the following questions:

Our team brought in a 508 SME in addition to our designer to facilitate 508 testing.   508 testing was done utilizing JAWS, the Wat tool bar and Keyboard Accessibility.

Through hands on testing feedback drove substantial design and functionality changes within the prototype. These changes were added to the backlog and the product owner prioritized them amongst the other outstanding tasks.
