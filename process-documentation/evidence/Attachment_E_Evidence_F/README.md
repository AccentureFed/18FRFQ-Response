Usability testing provided unique feedback from hands on users.  It gave direct input on how real users would use our system and provided an unbiased view.  Usability test cases were created and administered with users matching our defined personas.

Based on feedback received, the designs were refined and iterations made. 

A field survey was conducted at a local grocery chain to gain hands on feedback from individuals who would be using our prototype amongst their daily lives.  Four individuals provided a response and gave constructive feedback to drive functionality. 

The Site Survey entailed the following questions:

Our team brought in a 508 SME in addition to our designer to facilitate 508 testing.   508 testing was done utilizing JAWS, the Wat tool bar and Keyboard Accessibility.

Through hands on testing feedback drove substantial design and functionality changes within the prototype. These changes were added to the backlog and the product owner prioritized them amongst the other outstanding tasks.
