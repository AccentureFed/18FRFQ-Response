|a|assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted| Upon RFQ receipt, a Product Owner (PO) was assigned. He had extensive expertise in Agile coaching putting him in a position to assess alternatives and weigh tradeoffs related to the prototype. He was given authority to allocate resources and funding to ensure the appropriate skill sets were available.   The team was aware the PO had the ultimate authority to define features, assign tasks and prioritize the backlog.  The PO worked with the team to characterize the prototype vision, "an interactive tool used to inform and educate consumers of food product recalls in an open or closed status" and associated features. The PO was actively involved daily in contributing and soliciting feedback at sprint reviews and during the retro. Daily he conducted backlog grooming and prioritized tasks to ensure the team was working on the most important tasks. User stories, defects and infrastructure needs were balanced and prioritized against user value and time. |
