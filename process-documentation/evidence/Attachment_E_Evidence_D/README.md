|d|used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools|Human Centered Design stood as the backbone of our prototype.  The end user desiring information pertinent to FDA Food Recalls, their needs, wants and desires drove a prototype tailored uniquely to them. The First technique used, Understand User Context.  Three personas were developed to depict multiple user bases for the prototype, a Mom searching for information for her children, a Nutritionist looking for updates for her client base and an FDA Administrator monitoring site metrics and updating public information. Second technique, understand the aspirations of the end user. User stories describing the type of user, what they want and why with acceptance criteria was defined.  A survey was conducted at a local grocery store with four people matching our Personas to further understand functionality they envisioned.  Heavy PO engagement ensured their requirements were incorporated.  Technique Three, Implement Rapid Prototyping.  Once our understanding evolved, rapid prototyping allowed for design iterations and quick changes driven by continual feedback from the PO, Usability and 508 testing and the team.  Tasks were created and prioritized to ensure the most important work was being done to respond to user needs. Technique four, Test and Evaluate. We conducted usability testing with local and remote testers along with remote observers using a usability tool to allow collaboration between test administrators and remote observers. 508 and Accessibility testing using JAWS screen reader, the WAT tool bar and Keyboard Accessibility helped drive continuous improvement and enhance usability for disabled users.|

The team applied four human-centered design techniques in our prototype development.  Our process started and ended with people being at the center of our design and prototype creation. The below graphics depicts our Human Centered Design Process and the steps the team took to reach our final prototype design.

An initial UX Timeline was created upon RFQ reciept to ensure we built in multiple ways to capture and incorporate feedback.

As described above in our evidence response, four Human-Centered Design Techniques were used in our prototype development.

**Technique 1 - Understand User Concept**
Our initial white board visioning session with our team and Product Owner provided foresight into the prototype functionality, user base and purpose.

*Visioning*

Creating Personas allowed the end users to come alive.  Their needs, desires and purpose for use stood as the foundation for our user base.

*Persona Development*

The template to display and present Personas was first developed.

*Personas*
Three unique Personas depicted our user base.

**Technique 2 - Understand the Aspirations of the End User**

Defining and understanding the needs and desires of the end user was critical to ensure we hit the mark with our user base. Our initial concept defined early on what was needed and desired.

*Concept*

User stories were used to describe our user, what they wanted and why. These stories created a simplified description of a requirement that the team then turned into tasks. 

*User Stories*

A field survey was conducted to gain additional insight and understanding at a local grocery store.

Continual and iterative feedback from our product owner drove functionality requirements and aided in prioritization.

**Technique 3 - Implement Rapid Prototyping**

Rapid Prototyping allowed the designers to quickly mock up the various features of the prototype.  Quick iterations reflected in mockups were continually built to allow for daily design changes. The ability of the team to visually see the changes and incorporated feedback within a design provided context and clarity.

*WireFrame*

*Design Iterations*

**Technique 4 - Test and Evaluate**

Various testing methods such as usability and 508, allowed the team to gain unbiased stakeholder feedback from direct hands on information about the quality of the prototype.

*Usability Testing*
