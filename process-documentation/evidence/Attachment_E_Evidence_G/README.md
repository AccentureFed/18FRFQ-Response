|g|used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype |Following Agile best practices and utilizing the ceremonial engagements allowed our team to employ an iterative approach that was driven by feedback provided by the Product Owner, user and or through usability testing.  Daily Sprint reviews provided a working demo of the prototype and or review of documentation such as wire frames for the PO, development team and other stakeholders to view and give feedback. Local and remote Usability testing and 508 testing, drove subsequent changes and additional features to be added to the backlog.  Once new stories, features, defects, functionality or change requests had been captured via stickies on the KANBAN board, the product owner would prioritize the backlog based on user impact, time and value.  This prioritization enabled the PO during our daily sprint planning to set the sprint goals, and allow the team to define how those goals would be implemented and what could be taken on during the sprint. Feedback received during 508 testing had a higher user impact and value to the prototype user than small design changes driving those higher in the backlog to be worked. Our Agile approach ensured a constant feedback mechanism and opportunity to weigh new information against existing tasks thus driving dynamic versions of the prototype.|


Our Kanban board served as our workflow visualization tool that enabled the team to optimize the flow of work while ensuring feedback was driving our tasks. We choose to utilize an "arts and crafts" board exposing the prototype "backlog", "in-work", and "done" tasks on a large physical wall. Our Kanban board was co-located with the team allowing them a visual depiction of the work in progress.  Tasks on the board moved daily as the prototype progressed with new items being added to the backlog, and moving through the "in-work" and "done" phases. 

New items were added, work reprioritized, and the backlog continually groomed, based on iterative feedback received daily. Feedback was derived from Sprint reviews where the PO provided input,   508 and UAT testing with Users, and the team offering thoughts based on development or UI acknowledgements.  Embracing an iterative approach, and incorporating ideas and feedback allowed the team to continually ensure they were working on the most important tasks with the highest value.

Below is a representation of our Kanban board and design/prototype changes that progressed across the lifecycle of the project due to feedback informing work and direction.
