Below is an identical replica of our Attachment E submission.  To further elaborate on the evidence, we have provided a link to additional information reflecting images, videos, and documentation such as design mockups, to further demonstrate our understanding.

|a| assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility, and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted| X | [Evidence A](https://github.com/AccentureFed/process-documentation/tree/master/evidence/Attachment_E_Evidence_A) | 
|b| assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team including a minimum of 5 labor categories from the Development Pool labor categories to design and develop the prototype |X | [Evidence B](https://github.com/AccentureFed/process-documentation/tree/master/evidence/Attachment_E_Evidence_B) | 
|c| understand what people need, by including people in the prototype development and design process |X|[Evidence C](https://github.com/AccentureFed/process-documentation/tree/master/evidence/Attachment_E_Evidence_C)| 
|d| used at least three "human-centered design" techniques or tools |X| [Evidence D](https://github.com/AccentureFed/process-documentation/tree/master/evidence/Attachment_E_Evidence_D)|  
|e| created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library |X|evidence e | 
|f| performed usability tests with people |X|evidence f | 
|g| used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype | X|evidence g| 
|h| created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design |X |evidence h | 
|i| used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.) |X|evidence i | 
|j| deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used |X |evidence j | 
|k| wrote unit tests for their code |X |evidence k | 
|l| set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider |X |evidence l | 
|m| set up or used configuration management |X |evidence m | 
|n| set up or used continuous monitoring |X |evidence n | 
|o| provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine |X |evidence o|
