|h|created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design |The vision of our Prototype was to be responsive, interactive and viewable from multiple devices. Our personas described a set of users where the solution had to be versatile and seamlessly support a variety of end-user devices. Using responsive design techniques, the UX designers focused on crafting each targeted device to provide optimal viewing and interactive experiences. Users are presented not only different layouts based on devices but the content also adapts to specific device types and their orientation. Users of higher resolution devices (Desktop) will be presented with content that is suited to the userâ€™s behavior of perusing large data sets and research type patterns. Users on their mobile devices using the same application will be presented with content and layout that is conducive to their mobility behavior enabling quick access to critical information. Bootstrap responsive libraries were used to support auto sizing to minimize panning, resizing and scrolling. CSS3 was used to manage content responsiveness, sizing, and styling and overall design patterns of the application.|

Through prototype development we implemented an approach aimed at crafting our application to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across various devices.  Designs were created and data was visually displayed differently across various devices to be favorable for the user.  Thought and user engagement was done to understand what information and data was critical to be displayed with limited real-estate across devices. 

Below are the various responsive designs that were created for each device.
