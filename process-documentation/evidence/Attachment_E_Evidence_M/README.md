The team utilized Github as the sole source for configuration management. The backend development team had three developers work each part time, to ensure continuity and CM best practices they used Github time stamps and the check in-check-out feature to work on the most recent code sources.  The team faced a conflict where multiple developers altered the same component and had to verbally come together to ensure both sets of changes were incorporated into the final code. Face-to-Face communication and open dialogue among the team quickly allowed this issue to be resolved. In addition the team built in the ability to trace any warfile back to the Jenkins Job/Build and commit reference in Github.  This allowed tractability and a testing reference for each build. |
