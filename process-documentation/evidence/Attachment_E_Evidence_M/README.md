|m|set up or used configuration management |The team utilized Github as the sole source for configuration management. This was used for code, all design documents, and any associated documentation for the prototype. To ensure continuity and CM best practices the team used Githubs commit hash, and the check in-check-out feature to work on the most recent code sources. The team faced a conflict where multiple developers altered the same component and had to verbally come together to ensure both sets of changes were incorporated into the final code. Open communication and co-location among the team also ensured clarification and removed any discrepancies with documentation. In addition, the team modified the Grails build script allowing Jenkins to embed the job name, the build number, and the Git Commit hash into the war file. This allowed tractability and a testing reference for each build. |
