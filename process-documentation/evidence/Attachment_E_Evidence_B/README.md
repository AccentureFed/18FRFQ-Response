|b|assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team including a minimum of 5 labor categories from the Development Pool labor categories to design and develop the prototype| In preparation for the RFQ, a dedicated team with the required skill set was defined to respond to the proposal.  Extenuating circumstances upon RFQ drop required us to re-define 100% of our resources.  Within 24 hours, our full multidisciplinary team had been assigned, covering eight labor categories -Agile Coach, Visual Designer, Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester, Back End Developer, DevOps Engineer, Front End Developer, Product manager and Business Analyst.  Our Teamâ€™s Corporate reach back helped to address surge and evolving needs by tapping 3,800 US based Agile resources, 1,800 scrum masters and 800 DevOps practitioners.  Our proven experience executing Agile processes that has been applied to over 1,000 Agile Scrum, Kanban & Lean projects, spanning Federal & commercial projects, provided the framework and tools to quickly define sprint zero needs, and enable the teams to begin sprinting.  We strategically choose to keep our team small, 8 FTE, and run only a one feature team.  Our team was formed with the appropriate skill sets to define, build and test quality software.  Our team was empowered, self-organized and accountable for delivering value daily within each sprint. Our team did not have the luxury of each member dedicating 100% of their time to the RFQ.  Some roles were shared as team members came in and out.  With this, it was imperative that the team openly communicate, share dependencies, and resolve impediments together. |

Upon RFQ Drop, a small group read through the RFQ. Once we had an understanding of the requirement set, we began to pull the team together. Due to vacations, client commitments and other obligations our original team slated to support prototype development were unavailable. Quickly we assembled our Product Owner, Agile Coach and known team to begin our visioning session. We consciously choose a small team to be most productive with the quick turn around and open requirements. We followed the general scrum rule in creating our team of 7 +/- 2. Our team of eight, included a Product Owner, Agile coach, Visual Designer, Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester, Backend Web Developer, Front End Web Developer, DevOps Engineer and a Business Analyst. 
Our dedicated resources were our Product Manager, Agile coach and Business Analyst. The BackEnd and FrontEnd Web Developer, Devops Engineer, Visual Designer and Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Tester were part time resources that when combined each made up 1 FTE for each of the LCATS.
