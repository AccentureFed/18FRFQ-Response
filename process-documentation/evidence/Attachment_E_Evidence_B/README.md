At RFQ Drop, small group read through the RFQ. Once we had an Understanding of the requirement set we began to pull the team together. Due to vacations, client commitments and other obligations our original team slated to support prototype development were unavailable. Quickly we assemble our our Product Owner, Agile Coach and available team to begin our visioning session. \\
We conciously choose a small team to be most productive with the quick turn around and open requirements.  We followed the general scrum rule in creating our team of 7 +/- 2.  Our team incluided a Product Owner, Agile coach, Visual Designer, Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester, Backend Web Developer, Front End Web Developer, DevOps Engineer and a Business Analyst.  

Our dedicated resources were our Product Manager, Agile coach and Business Analyst.  The Back end and Front End Web Developer, Devops Engineer, Visual Designer and Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Tester were part time resources that when combined made up 1 FTE each for the LCATS.
