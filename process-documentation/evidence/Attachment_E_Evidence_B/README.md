|b|assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team including a minimum of 5 labor categories from the Development Pool labor categories to design and develop the prototype| In preparation for the RFQ, a dedicated team with the assumed skills was defined to respond the proposal.  Extenuating circumstances upon RFQ drop, required us to re-define 100% of our resources.  Within 24 hours, our full multidisciplinary team had been assigned, covering eight labor categories -Agile Coach, Visual Designer, Interaction Designer, Back End Developer, DevOps Engineer, Front End Developer, Product manager and Business Analyt.  Our Teamâ€™s Corporate reach back helps to address surge and evolving needs by tapping 3,800 US based Agile resources, 1,800 scrum masters and 800 DevOps practitioners.  Our proven experience executing Agile processes that has been applied to over 1,000 Agile Scrum, Kanban & Lean projects, spanning Federal & commercial projects, provided the framework and tools to quickly define sprint zero needs, and enable the teams to begin sprinting.  We strategically choose to keep our team small, X, and run only one feature team.  This decision was made ensuring the team had the appropriate skill sets to define, build and test quality software.  Our team was empowered, self-organized and accountable for delivering value daily within each sprint. Our team did not have the luxury of each member dedicating 100% of their time to the RFQ.  Some roles were shared as team members came in and out.  With this, it was imperative that the team openly communicate, share dependencies, and resolve impediments together. |
