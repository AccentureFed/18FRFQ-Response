|c|understand what people need, by including people in the prototype development and design process |Our team took a twofold approach focusing (1) on the end-user and (2) on our own development team to ensure people’s needs were accounted for through development.  To meet the needs of our defined end-users Personas, our front and back end development was driven by User Centered Design practices and methodologies. Our PO worked to define the prototype vision, the team crafted three personas, Ann Jordan a Mom, Steven Jones an FDA Administrator and Kathy Miller a Nutritionist, to define the user stories that drive functionality. Our PO provided clarification and feedback at each Sprint review and demo.  A field survey with four people at a local grocery store, defined prototype functionality requirements with real world users’ needs and concerns expressed.  Wire frames and design mock ups evolved and were modified from feedback through surveys, usability testing, Persona development, sprint reviews, UAT, and 508 testing. To ensure clarity and priority for our development team, daily ceremonial activities such as Sprint reviews, Backlog grooming and prioritization where the KANBAN board was updated, occurred on a regular cadence (daily).  These events promoted open dialogue and a venue to discuss success, impediments, and collaborate. |
