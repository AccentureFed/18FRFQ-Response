Mockups for Jigsaw

## Version 1.0
Initial Mockups were done by Hau Mai in Axure and Russell Lyons in Macaw. We took independent approaches so that we would not influence each other's thoughts about the design.

## Version 2.0
After comparing the 2 designs we incorporated the best aspects of each other into one design to move forward with so the development team had a single vision to focus on.

## Version 3.0
Refined the design after doing initial interactive phone and tablet views.

## Version 4.0 
Modified design layout and controls based on usability testing performed on the afternoon of 6/23.
