# Request for Quotation 4QTFHS150004 Multiple Award Blanket Purchase Agreement for Agile Delivery Services (ADS I) 

## Introduction
Upon receipt of the RFQ, our team decomposed the RFQ to understand the scope and initial resources required for the effort. The following describes our approach and a bit of the history of this short lived project.  We adapted a few agile techniques including Scrum, Kanban, and XP to support this effort. 

## Team & Environment
Although we had been anticipating the release of this RFQ, our original team members slated to be involved had other obligations preventing them from participating (vacation, business trips, customer deliveries, etc).  Despite the challenge, we were able to assemble another multidisciplinary team together within 24 hours, utilizing our bench of experienced agile resources and a tremendous team oriented spirit.  A core team of six formed around the expertise of front and back end developers, devops, Design, Agile Coaching and Product Manager input. None of our team members had worked together perviously, and organized with a remote and physical presence.  The Product Manager/Owner Greg Pfister, had the ultimate authority and responsibility for meeting the needs of the users and in doing so prioritizing features accordingly.

## Process
With a short delivery timeline, unrestricted requirements, and the need to keep team overhead down, we chose to leverage a physical Kanban board.  On large, long lived, and/or distributed team environments we  traditionally leverage a modern Agile Lifecycle tool (e.g. Rally, VersionOne, JiraAgile, etc); our current team was mostly co-located and those not, utilized skype and go-to meetings, decided to focus on a high visible, flexibile and accountable model.  

Understanding the needs of the end user was critical to ensure success and usability.  User Centric Design drove backend requirements that were fed to the front end developers.

Working with the Product Owner, we reviewed and identified a preferred dataset (FDA Food Recall Enforcement Reports) and generated several end-user personas to understand their needs and vision.  Based on the personas and dataset, we created user stories and mapped these stories into feature sets.  With the Product Owner, the team characterized the vision of the prototype as an interactive tool used to inform and educate consumers of food product recalls that are in an open or closed status. 

For our purposes, we effectively followed one day sprints.  This is outside our typical 2 week sprint model; however, due to the short turn around and necessary high-touch engagement, this was the best approach to ensure the solution and team were aligned and focused on delivering the highest business value items. At 9am each morning the team held a sprint review to demonstrate the solution and discuss with the team and stakeholders.  Any suggestions/ideas were captured as a part of the backlog (reflected on the Kanban board).  This was followed with a 'sprint planning' session that represented the work for the day.  At 3pm daily, we held a stand-up to take a step back to communicate what had been accomplished, what remained and identify impediments.  Our team, very experienced employing agile practices, used each team 'ceremony' as an opportunity to make process adjustments to help ensure we operated as effectively as possible.

## Tools
To remain Agile and lean, we leveraged several Agile Engineering Practices such as Continuous
Integration (CI) and Test Driven Development (TDD). Our approach leveraged automation in all facets of software development. We automated the software integration/build, unit testing, and acceptance testing. This approach integrated the developed software FREQUENCY and re-validated the software every time through automated unit and acceptance tests. Incrementally growing and testing the software resulted in a higher quality and timely solution.  Need to talk about configuration management and monitoring here.

Open source, modern technologies were chosen based on team preference, accounts created and access granted during this time. The Development team had access to all tools and began work on day one.

Due to limited time, a physical wall Kanban board was created to promote visibility, flexibility and accountability.  Open source, modern technologies were chosen based on team preference, accounts created and access granted during this time. The Development team had access to all tools and began work on day one.

## Conclusion
In spite of the very quick turn around and limited real world customer needs, we pulled together a very interesting and engaging prototype solution.  You can find further details about this project including pictures, videos, and the source code here.
