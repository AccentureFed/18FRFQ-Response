Multiple Award Blanket Purchase Agreement for Agile Delivery Services (ADS I) 

Agile Scrum is the methodology we used. Or Agile Development Life Cycle combines the Scrum framework with engineering practices to provide the most inclusive Agile solution. This methodology and solution is tool agnostic.

Upon receipt of the RFQ, our team decomposed the RFQ to understand the scope and initial resources required for the effort. A multidisciplinary team was formed, with a minimum of 5 labor categories from Pool 3, based on resource availability and skill sets required.  The team of six formed around the expertise of front end and back end developers, devops, Design, Agile Coaching and the input of a Product Manager. The Product Manager/Owner Greg Phister, has the ultimate authority and responsibility for meeting the needs of the users and in doing so prioritizing features accordingly. 

Due to limited time, a physical wall Kanban board was created to promote visibility, flexibility and accountability.  Open source, modern technologies were chosen based on team preference, accounts created and access granted during this time. The Development team had access to all tools and began work on day one.

Next, we worked with the Product Owner to understand their needs and vision by creating user stories, and prioritizing them into feature sets. The concept of the proto-type was defined utilizing the FDA “Food Recall Enforcement Reports.”  With the Product Owner, the team characterized the vision of the prototype as an interactive tool used to inform and educate consumers of food product recalls that are in an open and or closed status.  Based on the priority, we identified a subset of requirements to be put into the Sprint backlog.  

Understanding the needs of the end user was critical to ensure success and usability.

Our Sprints were set at one day time-boxed iterations where the team focused on this subset of features and requirements. At the end of the Sprint, the Product Owner and team members gathered for a Sprint review which provided an empirical view into the team’s progress. During this review, we demonstrated the software and work products that were produced and passed acceptance tests. 
Daily stand ups occurred at 9:00am in person and virtual. The team detailed what they completed yesterday, their goal for today and any impediments. In addition, a daily retrospective occurred at 3pm for the team to reflect on what happened that day and identify actions for improvement. 

Adjustments to the product backlog as a result of the Sprint review or a better understanding of needs occurred at any time. The Sprint review uses an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype.  The backlog was continuously prioritized allowing the team to produce the most valuable features. The Sprint process was repeated until the prototype was complete. 

To remain Agile and lean, we leveraged several Agile Engineering Practices such as Continuous
Integration (CI) and Test Driven Development (TDD). Our approach leveraged automation in all facets of software development. We automated the software integration/build, unit testing, and acceptance testing. This approach integrated the developed software FREQUENCY and re-validated the software every time through automated unit and acceptance tests. Incrementally growing and testing the software resulted in a higher quality and timely solution.  Need to talk about configuration management and monitoring here.
