## Introduction
A modified version of a few agile techniques including Scrum, Kanban, and XP were used to support this effort.  Upon receipt of the RFQ, our team decomposed the RFQ to understand the scope and initial resources required for the effort. The following describes our approach and a bit of the history of this short lived project.  

## Team & Environment
Although we had been anticipating the release of this RFQ, our original team members that we had planned to be involved had other obligations that had prevented them to participate (vacation, business trips, customer deliveries, etc).  Inspite of the obvious challenge, we were able to pull another multidisciplinary team together fairly quickly as we have many experienced agile resources and a tremendous team oriented spirit.  A base team of six formed around the expertise of front end and back end developers, devops, Design, Agile Coaching and the input of a Product Manager. Note that non of these team members had worked together before.  The Product Manager/Owner Greg Pfister, has the ultimate authority and responsibility for meeting the needs of the users and in doing so prioritizing features accordingly.

## Process
Due to nature of this project with very short timelines, very open requirements, and the need to keep overhead down to an absolute minimum, we decided to leverage a physical Kanban board.  On larger, longer lived, and/or distributed team environments we would typically leverage a modern Agile Lifecycle tool (e.g. Rally, VersionOne, JiraAgile, etc); in this case we had a mostly co-located team and decided to focus on a high visibility, flexibility and accountability model.  

Understanding the needs of the end user was critical to ensure success and usability.

Next, we worked with the Product Owner to identify the end-user personas and begin to understand their needs and vision by first reviewing the available datasets identifying a preferred dataset (FDA Food Recall Enforcement Reports) and creating user personas and related user stories.  We mapped these stories into feature sets.  With the Product Owner, the team characterized the vision of the prototype as an interactive tool used to inform and educate consumers of food product recalls that are in an open and or closed status.  Based on the backlog priority, we identified a subset of requirements to be put into the Sprint backlog. 

For our purposes, we effectively had one day sprints.  At 9am each morning we would have a brief sprint review where we would see a demonstration of the solution and have an open discussion with the team and stakeholders.  Any suggestions/ideas were captured as a part of the backlog (reflected on the Kanban board).  This was followed with a 'sprint planning' session that represented the work for the day.  This model is a outside of our typical 2 week sprint model; however, due to the short turn around and necessary high-touch engagement with the team we felt this was the best approach to ensure the solution and team were aligned and focused on delivering the highest business value items.  We would have a very brief stand-up each afternoon for the team to take a step back and communicate on what they have been able to accomplish, what was still in front of them and raise any impediments that may be impactful to the team.  Since our team is very familiar with agile practices, each team 'ceremony' was an opportunity to make any process adjustments to help ensure that our process operated as effectively as possible.

## Tools

To remain Agile and lean, we leveraged several Agile Engineering Practices such as Continuous
Integration (CI) and Test Driven Development (TDD). Our approach leveraged automation in all facets of software development. We automated the software integration/build, unit testing, and acceptance testing. This approach integrated the developed software FREQUENCY and re-validated the software every time through automated unit and acceptance tests. Incrementally growing and testing the software resulted in a higher quality and timely solution.  Need to talk about configuration management and monitoring here.

Open source, modern technologies were chosen based on team preference, accounts created and access granted during this time. The Development team had access to all tools and began work on day one.

Due to limited time, a physical wall Kanban board was created to promote visibility, flexibility and accountability.  Open source, modern technologies were chosen based on team preference, accounts created and access granted during this time. The Development team had access to all tools and began work on day one.

## Conclusion

![alt tag](https://github.com/AccentureFed/jigsaw-documentation/blob/master/images/response-images/agile-methodology.png?raw=true)

Adjustments to the product backlog as a result of the Sprint review or a better understanding of needs occurred at any time. The Sprint review uses an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype.  The backlog was continuously prioritized allowing the team to produce the most valuable features. The Sprint process was repeated until the prototype was complete.
